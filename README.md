# Employee-Attrition-Rate

## Problem Statement
Our client is ABC a leading firm and is doing well in the sector. It is recently facing a steep increase in its employee attrition . Employee attrition has gone up from 14% to 25% in the last 1 year . We are asked to prepare a strategy to immediately tackle this issue such that the firm’s business is not hampered and also to propose an efficient employee satisfaction program for long run. Currently, no such program is in place . Further salary hikes are not an option

## Techniques Used
In order to find a model which could help with the prediction process we ran several data mining models:

1. Logistic Regression,                                                                                                                                                             
2. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour),                                                                                                                                                       
3. Naïve Bayes,                                                                                                                                                                     
4. Decision Tree,                                                                                                                                                                   
5. Random Forest,                                                                                                                                                                   
6. Support Vector Machine and,
